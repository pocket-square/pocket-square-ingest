Is there a program for that?Updated Mar 23, 2015 · Featured in Inc and TimeFor anyone who wants to attain the vaunted title of "being well-read," it's more about breadth than depth. (As for feeling well-read, read the postscript.)To "feel" well-read in literature, it's all about the categories, not the books themselves. Read a few books in a few different genres, time periods,  points of views. I've thrown in a few controversial books, just so you know what all of the fuss is about. Here's how you can feel like a regular literari!:Western Classics (Ancient & Modern): to give you a good foundation for the who's who of Western literature. The Odyssey (Homer): epic of a dude who just can't get home without a little help from the gods. (Extra credit if you read the Iliad, too!)A Tale of Two Cities (Charles Dickens): the quintessential story of the French Revolution, love, and longing.Pride & Prejudice (Jane Austen): the story that started the "hate at first sight turning into love" trope.Anna Karenina (Leo Tolstoy): Very long. Very melodramatic. Very Russian. Very classic!  Dystopia: the stuff of our worst fears and nightmares. Nineteen-Eighty-Four (George Orwell): the book that introduced "doublethink" into our lexicon. Brave New World (Aldous Huxley): another classic dystopia. Gammas, Deltas, oh my!The Handmaid's Tale (Margaret Atwood): a feminist spin on the genre.Science Fiction & Fantasy: we can't overlook the geeky cousin of the classics, can we?The Lord of the Rings series (J.R.R. Tolkien): this guy made the epic (also called high) fantasy genre. Be warned, it's a bit of a dry read.The Foundation series (Issac Asimov): some of the pioneering stories in science fiction, natch! Neuromancer (William Gibson): here's something a bit more modern. Plus, you just can't beat “The sky above the port was the color of television, tuned to a dead channel" as a snappy first line. Great American Novels: these zeitgeist works practically defined a time period of U.S. history.The Great Gatsby (F. Scott Fitzgerald): you can't think of the Jazz Age without thinking of "old sport." Bonfire of Vanities (Tom Wolfe): the terrible movie nonwithstanding, this book captured the self-indulgence of the 80s NYC crowd. The Grapes of Wrath (John Steinbeck): I dare you to get into a conversation about the Great Depression without thinking of this book. I dare you. Literary Heavy Hitters: books that make people go "Whoa, dude!" when you say that you've read them.Ulysses (James Joyce): stream-of-consciousness writing plus an unhealthy sexual obsession with an orphan with a limp equal literary greatness. True story.Infinite Jest (David Foster Wallace): fractals, man! Fractals! Gravity's Rainbow (Thomas Pynchon): lots of stuff happens that a lot of people pretend to understand.Popular Fiction: those guilty indulgences that everyone has read (but won't necessarily admit to it). Warning: this is U.S.-centric, feel free to indulge in your country's guilty pleasures. A Song of Ice and Fire series (George R. R. Martin): hey, there's a popular HBO miniseries about it! The Hunger Games (Suzanne Collins): better than Twilight. Fifty Shades of Grey (E.L. James): be torn between hilarity and despair in this BDSM spin-off of a Twilight fan fiction. Who knows, maybe this'll spice up the bedroom.Immigrant Experience (U.S./U.K.): ah, the magical experience of being thrust into a new culture.Interpreter of Maladies (Jhumpa Lahiri): say hello to our recent Indian arrivals! (For our tea-drinking cousins across the pond, try Monica Ali's Brick Lane.)Joy Luck Club (Amy Tan): the book that inspired a movie and furor in the Asian American community about stereotypes and Tan's possible self-loathing. (For a less controversial read, try Ha Jin's Waiting--and yes, there's a lot of longing and waiting there.)How the Garcia Girls Lost Their Accents (Julia Alvarez): how four sisters start to forget their Spanish and their native homeland of the Dominican Republic. Non-Western Classics (Ancient): if Westerners get theirs, so should the rest of the world. Ramayana (India): this is THE Hindu epic. Full stop.Romance of the Three Kingdoms (China): a bit of Chinese history, highly romanticized and dramatized. Kind of like "A World Turns."Non-Western Classics (Modern): the stuff that you should read to feel worldly and well-read. (More applicable if you're from the U.S. or Western Europe.)One Hundred Years of Solitude (Gabriel Garcia Marquez): this novel single-handedly legitimatized Latin American literature in modern times. Too bad you don't know who he's talking about half of the time. To Live (Yu Hua): getting banned in China just adds to its street cred. Things Fall Apart (Chinua Achebe): the sad tale of colonialism in Africa. Definitely merits a frowny-face. Satire: throw in a little giggle into your reading list. Cat's Cradle (Kurt Vonnegut): some say Slaughterhouse-Five is his best, I say this one. Also: Bokononism!Catch-22 (Joseph Heller): come and see what the catch-22 is. I promise you, it's gorgeously ironic. The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (Douglas Adams): you kill two birds with two stones here: sci-fi and satire. Whee!This is where I reach the end of my endurance. I haven't even gotten into the non-fiction stuff, but alas ... I must eat.With this list, you'll feel like you can dominate the Trivial Pursuit literature section! Life is good. Postscript: since this question is more about sentiment than reality ... I hate to break it to you, but if you're truly a well-read person, you will never feel well-read. They're always on the lookout for their next book--that category that they're missing--to add to their impressive list. It's a Sisyphean goal, really. If you feel well-read, you're probably not.78.1k Views · View UpvotesRelated QuestionsMore Answers BelowWhat books should one read to feel alive?What books are essential must-reads on the path to becoming 'well read'?Is it possible to read a 400-page book in one day?What 10 books should I read to get started on a journey to become well-read?Which books should I read to become well-read in 2014?  Sotiris Papanikolaou, Civil EngineerWritten Feb 16, 2012There are so many great books, that it would take a lifetime before you could have read half of them. However if I had to choose 20 books these would be a serious consideration. The Iliad and Odyssey by Homer, The Republic by Plato, Persians by Aeschylus, Birds by Aristophanes, Histories by Herodotus, the History of Rome by Livy, one of the major plays of Shakespeare (my favorite is MacBeth), Dante's Divine Comedy, Don Quixote by Cervantes, Faust by Goethe, War and Peace by Tolstoy, Crime and Punishment by Dostoyevsky, the Prince by Machiavelli, the Wealth of Nations by Smith, the Capital by Marx,  the Trial by Kafka, Frankenstein by Shelley, les Miserables by Hugo, A farewell to arms by Hemingway, the Lord of the Rings by Tolkien.All these are considered groundbreaking works, and may not be the best books ever (I don't believe such a thing exists), but all changed in a way the history of western literature.6.9k Views · View Upvotes  Zac Scy, Reader & writer.

I am comparatively well read compared to the average person because I read voraciously as a child and teenager, but in my adult life I've been remiss in keeping up on it--and so I don't really feel well read anymore.I think it's a bit optimistic to think that a reading list of 10-20 books would give you a well rounded knowledge of everything. That being said, these are some seminal books that I can think of: Arguably the most important novel, if only because it started a genre, is Don Quixote by Miguel Cervantes.If you're interested in the feminist movement,  The Feminine Mystique by Betty Friedan or The Second Sex by Simone de Beauvoir are both seminal works that spearheaded second-wave feminism.If you like self-righteous indignation (and who doesn't!) about the state of the American food industry, read Fast Food Nation.If you like science fiction, read Asimov or Bradbury. If you like science fiction and want to stray from the many-times-over trodden path, read Stanislaw Lem (Solaris or Fiasco are personal favorites).But those are just very general recommendations. I can start throwing writers' names at you instead (though my list is going to be heavily , perhaps entirely, fiction writers): Rushdie, Dickens, Bulgakov, Hardy, Austen, Shakespeare, Dostoyevski, Verne, Hugo, Tolkien, Heinlein, Nabokov, etc, etc, etc.The important thing is to get started. Find a book that looks interesting, write down books that sound interesting, and follow your list.4.8k Views · View UpvotesMoreRelated QuestionsWhere can I get online PDF or EPUB versions of books?How do you become a well-read individual?How does it feel to randomly encounter someone who has read one of your books?If you are allowed to read only 1 book in your entire life, what book would you recommend?How do you feel when you read a book?What book series should I read?How long will it take to read a 366 page book?What is a list of books to read which would make me well-read?How can I read literary books well?Why does one re-read a book?If there was only one book to read in order to develop my interpersonal skills and daily wellness, which one would it be?How can I read a book a week?I read a book for one hour everyday and now I feel mentally sharper, why?Which feel-good books are good to read?What books should i read if I want to be well read?Related QuestionsWhat books should one read to feel alive?What books are essential must-reads on the path to becoming 'well read'?Is it possible to read a 400-page book in one day?What 10 books should I read to get started on a journey to become well-read?Which books should I read to become well-read in 2014?Where can I get online PDF or EPUB versions of books?How do you become a well-read individual?How does it feel to randomly encounter someone who has read one of your books?If you are allowed to read only 1 book in your entire life, what book would you recommend?How do you feel when you read a book?Top StoriesRead MoreWas it appropriate for the cast of Hamilton to read a statement to Vice President-elect Pence from the stage on November 18th?
